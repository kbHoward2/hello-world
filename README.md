Hi I'm Kannon. I love computers and technology and I also love learning. I have a bachelors degree in Information Technology and I have always been interested in coding throughtout my time in college. I have written some code 5-6 years ago but I am looking for a fresh start in skills that I could hope to apply professionally some day.
